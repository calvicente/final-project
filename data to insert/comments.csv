FMB2_101;;;No current No wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to port;The ship model is realistic. You need a lot of bow thruster power to get her to turn.;Yes;The visulas are ok;Yes;Famil run;;
FMB2_102;;;Ebb No wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to port;;Yes;The ebb tide model is consistent with the average ebb tide experienced in Dover.;Yes;Famil run;;
FMB2_103;;;Flood No wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to port;Good suggestion for swinging area that you shouldn’t let the bow cross the line of the Breakwaters as you can get a tidal rip just outside the port ;Yes;The flood tide model is consistent with the average ebb tide experienced in Dover.  Aim to intersect the 250deg track 0.5nm from the Eastern Entrance. This intersection correlates to the weakening the Northerly current. The heading of the vessel should then be in the area of Dover VTS or atleast the northern side of the entrance, anticipating the Southerly current from 0.4nm up until the entrance.;Yes;;Partially;
FMB2_104;;;Ebb SW wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to port;Good speed into turn but swung a little too early meaning that we ended up with the bow slightly higher than planned, athough very comfortable, would have been more work to fight to get back toward the berth on final approach ;Yes;SW'ly wind combined with ebb tide can often result in zero set at the entrance.;Yes;;Partially;
FMB2_105;TRUE;;Flood SW wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to port;;Yes;;Yes;;Yes;
FMB2_201;;;Flood SW wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to stbd;Run started inside the harbour at 7kn. Swing conducted in the wider middle section of the Harbour which allowed much greater space. Closest point was recorded at 150m. Also allowed plenty of room to set should wind pick up and provided a good abort option through the Eastern entrance once the swing had been completed ;Yes;Only comment was to be sure that the speed is well under control before swinging to stbd towards the WD4 quayside.;Yes;;Partially;
FMB2_202;TRUE;;Ebb SW wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to stbd;Same as previous swing but with increased wind . Swing felt again very comfortable with plenty of room and option to abort through Eastern BW once swing completed and stern to wind ;Yes;Comfortable throughout, didn't need much thruster power for sustained periods so plenty in hand.;Yes;;Yes;
FMB2_203;TRUE;;Flood NE wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to stbd;Swing in the middle basin was comfortable and the slow-down was acceptable in the conditions. Once completed the swing you have a good option to abort through the Eastern entrance ;Yes;Good idea to be at the lower end of the 8-10 entry speed with a NE'ly wind.;Yes;Position the bow in the NE qaudrant of the turning circle;Yes;
FMB2_204;TRUE;;Ebb NE wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to stbd;;Yes;;Yes;;Yes;
FMB2_205;TRUE;;Ebb NE wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to stbd;Completed with XL - entering the BW at 9.5Knots and stopped very well with around 50RPM astern. Plenty of room in the swing with option to abort through Easter BW - used 20/30% with bow thrust during swing and 40RPM in the swing  ;Yes;Not much to add, felt under control throughout with minimal power being used.;Yes;;Yes;
FMB2_301;TRUE;;Flood SSW wind;Arrival SSTQ swing bow to stbd;;;Near repeat of last exercise yesterday. Wind balanced tide at the entrance.;;;Yes;
FMB2_302;;;Flood SW wind;Departure Western Entrance;POD shuffle exiting via Southern BW with S Wind. Using a balance between POD angle and thruster to zero the drift which was very comfortable and achievable. ;;Easy controlled slow departure, ship handled it really wel..;;;;
